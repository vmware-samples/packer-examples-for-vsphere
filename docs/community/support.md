# Support

We welcome you to use the GitHub [issues][issues] tracker to report bugs or suggest features and enhancements.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure someone else hasn't already
reported the issue.

Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps.
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug.
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment.

You can also start a discussion on the [discussions][discussions] area to ask questions or share ideas.
